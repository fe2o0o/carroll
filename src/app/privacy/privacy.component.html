    <ol>
      <li>Introduction</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>Welcome to Car Roll-Dice, an online platform for buying and selling cars through auctions. By using our website,
        you agree to comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions. Please review these terms carefully.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ol start="2">
      <li>Definitions</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>Platform: Car Roll-Dice website.</li>
      <li>User: Any individual who registers and uses the platform, including bidders and auctioneers.</li>
      <li>Bidder: A user who places bids on car listings.</li>
      <li>Auctioneer: A user who lists cars for auction.</li>
      <li>Auction: The process through which cars are sold to the highest bidder.</li>
      <li>QR Code: A unique code provided to final bidders for showroom access.</li>
      <li>In the context of Car Roll-Dice, multiple winning bidders refer to the scenario where more than one bidder is
        considered a "winner" at the end of an auction. This concept addresses the possibility that the highest bidder might
        decide not to proceed with the purchase after inspecting the car, which could be problematic for both the platform
        and the auctioneer.</li>
      <li><strong>Multiple Winning Bidders Concept:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Primary Winner: The highest bidder at the end of the auction is considered the primary winner and gets the
            first opportunity to purchase the car.</li>
          <li>Secondary Winners: Other top bidders (e.g., the second and third highest) are also given a chance to purchase
            the car if the primary winner decides not to proceed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Multiple Winning Bidders Process:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Auction Ends: The auction concludes with the highest bid identified as the primary winning bid.</li>
          <li>Inspection and Test Drive: The primary winner inspects the car and takes a test drive.</li>
          <li>Decision:
            <ul>
              <li>If the primary winner agrees to purchase: The transaction is completed, and the car is sold.</li>
              <li>If the primary winner declines: The next highest bidder (secondary winner) is given the opportunity to
                inspect and purchase the car.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Refund Policy: If the primary winner declines the purchase, their deposit is refunded, and the process moves
            to the secondary winner.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Multiple Winning Bidders Example:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Auction Ends: Bidder A wins with 100,000 EGP, Bidder B with 95,000 EGP, and Bidder C with 90,000 EGP.</li>
          <li>Inspection: Bidder (A) inspects the car.</li>
          <li>If Bidder (A) Declines: Bidder (B) is invited to inspect and purchase the car.</li>
          <li>If Bidder (B) Also Declines: Bidder (C) is given the opportunity.</li>
        </ul>
